# Tempo Frontend challenge

# Solution Improvement

### Several files were replaced/revamped to achieve best performance on the interface at all
### The main aim of great part of refactoring made were to clean code and easy reading of components code for better understanding to everyone that needs to continue the implementations
### A .editorconfig file was added to improve the standardization of the project in different environments
### A global context was implemented to improve the exchange of information between components and pages, improving performance without the need to pass IDs by query params
### The look and feel of the interface was imporved

##### I would like to make it clear that unit tests are not one of my strongest pillars, as I have participated in numerous projects and so far none of them had a testing culture, but I am super willing to learn and improve the little I know about testing! You can count on me! ðŸ˜ƒ

## To Run the project you must run on your terminal:

```
npm install
```

## After the installation finished, you can run:

```
npm start
```

<br/>

### You can also build the project by running:

```
npm build
```
### And in the project's directory run:

```
serve -s build
```
##### For running the production build version, you need to have "serve" globally installed on you environment
###### To do that, run 'npm i -g serve' with no quotes :)
<br/>

#### The project will open in your browser with the following url http://localhost:3000;

<br/>

## To run the tests yo must run

```
npm run test
```
